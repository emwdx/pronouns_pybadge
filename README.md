# pronouns_pybadge
 This is a Circuitpython program that runs on the Adafruit Pybadge to cycle through one's preferred pronouns on the display. 
 
The code is adapted from the Conference Badge at https://learn.adafruit.com/pybadge-conference-badge-multi-language-unicode-fonts/overview

Pronouns are set on line 31. Enter the pronoun with the most letters _first_ so the label is initialized with enough characters to show them all.
